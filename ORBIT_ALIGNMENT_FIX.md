# Major Moon Orbit Alignment Fix - Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Moons appeared off their orbital paths

---

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

When toggling between **Real Proportions** and **Enlarged** modes, major moon orbital path lines did not pass through the actual moon positions. The moons appeared to be orbiting at different radii than their visible orbital paths.

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Bug Sequence:

1. **Initial State (Enlarged Mode):**
   - Major moons initialized with `orbitScale = 50`
   - `cachedOrbitalData[moonKey].orbitRadiusScene = kmToScene(orbitRadius) * 50`
   - Orbit lines created with same calculation ✓
   - **Moons and orbits aligned** ✓

2. **User Clicks "Real Proportions":**
   - `updatePlanetSizeMode('real')` is called
   - Planets are rebuilt with new sizes ✓
   - Sun is rebuilt ✓
   - Earth's Moon is rebuilt ✓
   - ISS is rebuilt ✓
   - **Major moons are NOT rebuilt** ❌
   - `resetMoonOrbitInitialization()` disposes orbit lines ✓
   - Next frame: orbit lines recreated with `orbitScale = 100` ✓

3. **Result:**
   - Orbit lines: `kmToScene(orbitRadius) * 100` = **141.0 scene units** (Io example)
   - Moon position: `cachedOrbitalData.orbitRadiusScene` = **70.5 scene units** (old value!)
   - **MISMATCH:** Orbit is 2x larger than where moon actually orbits ❌

### Why This Happened:

The `cachedOrbitalData` object is created during `initMajorMoons()` and contains:
```javascript
cachedOrbitalData[moonKey] = {
    orbitRadiusScene: kmToScene(moonData.orbitRadius) * orbitScale,
    periodMs: daysToMs(moonData.orbitPeriod),
    rotationSpeedPerSec: ...
};
```

This cached data is used every frame in `updateMajorMoons()` to position the moons. When scale mode changed, **this cached data was never updated** because major moons were never rebuilt!

## ✅ THE FIX

### Code Changes:

**File:** `src/modules/planets.js` (line 631-644)

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```javascript
await Promise.all([
    initPlanets(currentStyle),
    import('./sun.js').then(({ initSun }) => initSun(currentStyle)),
    import('./moon.js').then(({ initMoon }) => initMoon(currentStyle)),
    import('./iss.js').then(({ initISS }) => initISS(currentStyle))
]);
// Major moons NOT rebuilt - cached data stays old!
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```javascript
let rebuiltPlanets = null;
await Promise.all([
    initPlanets(currentStyle).then(planets => { rebuiltPlanets = planets; }),
    import('./sun.js').then(({ initSun }) => initSun(currentStyle)),
    import('./moon.js').then(({ initMoon }) => initMoon(currentStyle)),
    import('./iss.js').then(({ initISS }) => initISS(currentStyle))
]);

// CRITICAL: Also rebuild major moons with new scale
await import('./moons.js').then(({ initMajorMoons }) =>
    initMajorMoons(currentStyle, rebuiltPlanets)
);
```

### What This Does:

1. Captures the rebuilt planets reference
2. After all parallel rebuilds complete, rebuilds major moons
3. Major moons call `initMajorMoons()` which:
   - Disposes old moon meshes
   - Gets current size mode
   - Calculates NEW `orbitScale` (100 for real, 50 for enlarged)
   - Creates fresh `cachedOrbitalData` with NEW scale
   - Creates new moon meshes

4. Now when orbit lines are recreated (next frame), they use SAME scale as moons
5. Perfect alignment achieved! ✅

## 📊 VERIFICATION

### Test Case: Io (Jupiter's innermost moon)

**NASA Data:**
- Orbit radius: 421,700 km
- Should be 6.03x Jupiter radius

**Enlarged Mode (orbitScale = 50):**
```javascript
Moon orbit = kmToScene(421,700) * 50 = 70.5 scene units
Orbit line = kmToScene(421,700) * 50 = 70.5 scene units
✓ MATCH
```

**Real Mode (orbitScale = 100):**
```javascript
Moon orbit = kmToScene(421,700) * 100 = 141.0 scene units
Orbit line = kmToScene(421,700) * 100 = 141.0 scene units
✓ MATCH
```

**Toggle Real → Enlarged → Real:**
- Each time, moons are rebuilt with fresh cached data
- Orbit lines are disposed and recreated
- Both always use matching scale
- ✓ ALWAYS ALIGNED

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

- [x] Enlarged mode: Moons on their orbital paths
- [x] Real mode: Moons on their orbital paths
- [x] Toggle Enlarged → Real: Moons stay on paths
- [x] Toggle Real → Enlarged: Moons stay on paths
- [x] Multiple toggles: Always aligned
- [x] All 7 moons tested: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, Rhea, Iapetus
- [x] Works with "Show Orbits" toggle on/off

## 📝 FILES MODIFIED

1. **`src/modules/planets.js`** (line 631-644)
   - Added `initMajorMoons()` call after planet rebuild
   - Captures rebuilt planets reference for passing to moons

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Key Insight:
**When you dispose and recreate visual elements (orbit lines), you must ALSO rebuild the source data (moon positions) they're based on.**

### Pattern to Remember:
```
If orbit visualization scale changes:
  → Dispose orbit lines ✓
  → Recreate orbit lines with new scale ✓
  → BUT ALSO rebuild moons with new scale! ✓✓✓
```

### Why Cached Data is Tricky:
- Caching is great for performance (avoid recalculating every frame)
- BUT cached data must be invalidated when source parameters change
- In this case: `orbitScale` parameter changed, so cache must be rebuilt

### The Complete Rebuild Chain:
```
updatePlanetSizeMode() called
  ↓
Set new scale mode globally
  ↓
Rebuild planets (they read new scale)
  ↓
Rebuild Sun (reads new scale)
  ↓
Rebuild Earth's Moon (reads new scale)
  ↓
Rebuild major moons (reads new scale) ← WAS MISSING!
  ↓
Reset orbit initialization flag
  ↓
Next frame: Recreate orbit lines (read new scale)
  ↓
✓ Everything aligned with new scale
```

## ✅ STATUS

**FIXED:** Commit `472f228`
**Verified:** All major moons now stay on their orbital paths in both scale modes
**Impact:** CRITICAL fix - Makes orbit visualization educationally accurate

---

**The orbital path lines now perfectly represent where the moons actually orbit!** 🎯🌙
