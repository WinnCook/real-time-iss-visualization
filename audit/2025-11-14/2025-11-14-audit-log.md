## Critical Actions Required

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. Pin Three.js version to r160
2. Remove window.APP global exposure
3. Begin test framework setup

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
4. Refactor ui.js into smaller modules
5. Add error boundaries to animation loop
6. Implement API failure notifications

### Medium-term (Within 1 month)
7. Set up build pipeline
8. Add input validation
9. Implement proper logging system

---

## Audit Deliverables

### Created Documentation
1. ✓ 2025-11-14-audit-protocol.md - Methodology documentation
2. ✓ 2025-11-14-findings-report.md - Comprehensive findings
3. ✓ 2025-11-14-remediation-backlog.md - Actionable checklist
4. ✓ 2025-11-14-audit-log.md - This progress log

### Key Recommendations
1. **Testing is Critical:** 0% coverage is the biggest risk
2. **Refactor UI Module:** 1,619 LOC is unmaintainable
3. **Security Hardening:** Remove global exposure, add CSP
4. **Modern Tooling:** Add build process for optimization
5. **Maintain Quality:** Good foundation, needs polish

---

## Audit Conclusion

The Real-Time Geometric Visualization project demonstrates professional development practices with excellent documentation and clear architecture. However, the complete absence of automated testing and the monolithic UI module represent significant risks that should be addressed immediately.

The codebase is production-viable with the implementation of the critical fixes identified. The estimated 31-53 hours of technical debt is reasonable for a project of this size and can be addressed incrementally.

### Final Recommendation
**Proceed with deployment after addressing Critical priority items. Schedule refactoring sprint for High priority items within 2 weeks.**
